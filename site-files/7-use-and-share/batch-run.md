# Step 14: Run a bunch with a batch script

Provided an example batch script where you provide a list of inputs via CSV file and send the inputs to your run command.

Example takes a CSV file as input and expects to find your files in the locations provided
Incorporate your run command in the batch script template but replace your specific values with the values from the CSV file.

Be careful when running the script locally


If you are running on a high-performance computing system that uses SLURM here is an example as well for using your singularity container image.
