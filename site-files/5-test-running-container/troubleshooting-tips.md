# Troubleshooting tips
## Error messages
- find the first error message to diagnose your problem
- you can also run and send your error output to a text file with piping/carrot (get exact name)
## files not appearing
- go to the most recent step where that file should be created. make sure the prior command had the correct input and output. you can try running the same command as a single line (example run command with mapping). you can try setting up a mini-script to test just that step of the container, or test everything up to a particular step.
